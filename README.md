# DeepChords

In this project I want to make a model to generate meaningful sequences of chords. <br>
To do this I use Wikifonia .mxl dataset with 6675 audio files in a rich music format.<br>

This in progress task :) So far I only extracted sequencies of chords from every song. Will keep updating. 

I am using `music21` python package to work with .mxl files.

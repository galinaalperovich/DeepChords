# DeepChords

In this project I want to make a model generating meaningful sequences of chords (see [chord progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression)). <br>
To do this I use Wikifonia `.mxl` dataset with 6675 audio files in a rich music format.<br>

This is in progress task :)
So far I only extracted sequences of chords from every song.

Will keep updating.

I am using `music21` python package to work with `.mxl` files.
